#Small animal survey data

This is a survey of small animals from `r nlevels(as.factor(surveys_complete$plot_id))` plots
from the years `r min(surveys_complete$year)` to `r max(surveys_complete$year)`. Each row is an animal. 
Each column is an attribute of that animal. The variables recorded are `r names(surveys_complete)`.

#Sex table
Here is a breakdown of the number of female vs male animals observed in the study

```{r, table, echo = FALSE}
kable(surveys_complete%>%
                group_by(sex)%>%
                tally)
```

#Mean weight
The mean weight of all animals surveyed 
is `r mean(surveys_complete$weight, na.rm=TRUE)`.

#Relationship between hindfoot length and weight
We are interested in the relationship between weight and hindfoor length by species. Here is a graph.

```{r graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig 1: Weight vs. hindfoot length"}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, 
       aes(x = weight, 
           y = hindfoot_length, 
           color = species_id)) + 
          geom_point(alpha = 0.1,
           aes(color = species_id))
